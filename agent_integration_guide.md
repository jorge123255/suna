# Agent Integration Guide

This document provides instructions on how to integrate the agent guides and examples into your existing agent system to fix the issues with tool usage and reasoning.

## Overview of Issues and Solutions

1. **TodoList Tool Usage**: Agents weren't properly using the TodoList tool format
2. **Reasoning Capabilities**: Agents were running tools without interpreting results
3. **XML Tool Format**: Agents may not understand proper XML tool calling formats

## Implementation Status

The following implementations have been completed to address these issues:

1. **Fixed WebSearchTool for Weather Queries**:
   - Implemented direct weather data extraction in WebSearchTool
   - Added methods to parse and format weather information
   - Fixed location extraction from user queries
   - Eliminated circular dependency with the post-processor

2. **System Prompt Updates**:
   - Added detailed tool usage guidelines with proper XML formats
   - Included specific guidance for TodoList tools with proper XML tags
   - Added weather query processing guidelines to extract meaningful information

3. **Created Self-Monitoring Tool**:
   - Added ToolStatusTracker to detect when the agent is returning raw tool output
   - Implemented reasoning quality monitoring to improve agent responses

4. **Added Integration Module**:
   - Created agent_integration.py to load guides into system prompts
   - Implemented methods to integrate guide content dynamically

5. **Created Test Script**:
   - Added test_agent_integration.py to verify correct behavior
   - Included tests for both TodoList and weather query features

## Technical Implementation Details

### Weather Query Processing

We've integrated weather processing directly into the WebSearchTool class with these components:

1. **Weather Query Detection**: `_is_weather_query()` method identifies when users ask about weather
2. **Location Extraction**: `_extract_location()` parses the location from the query string
3. **Weather Data Extraction**: `_extract_weather_data()` pulls temperature, conditions, etc. from search results
4. **Response Formatting**: `_format_weather_response()` creates a clean, readable weather response

### TodoList Tools Integration

The TodoGeneratorTool has been enhanced with:

1. **XML Schema Definition**: Added proper XML tags (ensure-todo, update-todo) with examples
2. **System Prompt Guidelines**: Added instructions to make Todo creation the first step
3. **Contextual Usage Patterns**: Added examples of Todo tracking throughout tasks

### Self-Monitoring

The ToolStatusTracker enables:

1. **Tool Usage Tracking**: Records execution history and patterns
2. **Reasoning Quality Detection**: Identifies when responses are missing analysis
3. **Self-Correction Hints**: Provides feedback to the agent on improving responses

## Usage Instructions

To use the implemented features:

1. **Weather Queries**: Simply ask about weather in any location, the agent will now format a proper response
2. **TodoList Workflow**: Start any project with the TodoGeneratorTool, then update tasks as you progress

## Verification

To verify your implementation:

1. Run the test_agent_integration.py script
2. Test weather queries like "What's the weather in New York?"
3. Test TodoList integration with a multi-step project

All tools now use proper XML formatting as defined in agent_tool_examples.md.
